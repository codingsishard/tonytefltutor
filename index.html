About me:
Hi everyone! my name is Anthony 
Peter Azzopardi and I am a Certified 
TEFL teacher from LTTC London. I 
teach both Greek and English in 
various platforms such as LiveXP, 
Preply, solo tutoring on Zoom etc...
I have been teaching for more than
ten years now to all levels and ages 
to students in many countries such 
China , Peru to name a few and this
gave me the chance to understand the
challenges that every person faces 
from different backgrounds in learning
a language, let us take the journey
of learning Greek or English together 
as i come from a multilingual background
myself as my Father was British and my 
Mother was of Swedish - German decent
but i was born on the beautiful island 
of Cyprus which in itself is a multicultural
country.</div>

    Method of teaching:
I focus more on the personality 
of the student rather than his 
or her level and that is why i 
teach only 1:1 sessions as i 
think a classroom with more than
one participants will compromise
the special attention that the
student needs in order to improve
the goals of each learner. I do
begin with a very basic foundation
of grammar as it is necessary and 
unrealistic to expect that  the 
complete absence of it will be 
possible.  Grammar as a starter 
will help to form the structure 
with which we shall move on into 
conversational learning and from 
there and on the sky is the limit.
